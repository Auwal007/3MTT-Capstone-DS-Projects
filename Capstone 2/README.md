# Fake News Detection - Capstone Project 2

## üéØ Project Objective

This capstone project focuses on detecting fake news using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. As part of the 3MTT (3 Million Technical Talent) program, this project demonstrates practical application of text classification methods for identifying misinformation.

**Goal**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify news articles as fake or real while gaining hands-on experience with NLP techniques and text data processing.

## üìä Dataset

- **Size**: 12,999 news posts from 244 websites
- **Features**: Text content, timestamps, URLs, domain information
- **Labels**: Binary classification (fake vs. real news)
- **Source**: Automatically downloaded from Google Drive in the notebook

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, special character removal, stopword removal)
- Missing value handling
- Basic feature extraction (word count, sentiment analysis)

### Feature Engineering
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: 5,000 text features for classification
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER sentiment scores
- **Temporal Features**: Publication time patterns
- **Domain Analysis**: Website source indicators

### Model Development
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression and Linear SVC
- **Data Split**: 75/25 train-test split with stratified sampling
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics

## üìà Results

### Model Performance
- **Logistic Regression**: 88.31% accuracy, 78.54% precision
- **Linear SVC**: 88.40% accuracy, 78.15% precision
- **F1-Scores**: Both models achieved ~83% F1-score

### Key Learning Insights
1. **TF-IDF Features**: Most effective for text classification
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Provided additional classification power
3. **Model Comparison**: Both algorithms performed similarly well
4. **Feature Engineering**: Critical for improving model performance
