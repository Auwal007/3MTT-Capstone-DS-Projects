# Delivery Delay Prediction - Capstone Project 4

## üéØ Project Objective

This capstone project focuses on optimizing logistics and supply chain operations by predicting delivery delays using machine learning. As part of the 3MTT (3 Million Technical Talent) program, this project simulates working as a data scientist for SwiftChain Analytics to solve one of the most challenging problems in supply chain management.

**Goal**: Develop a predictive model to classify delivery outcomes and provide actionable insights to reduce delivery delays and enhance operational efficiency.

## üìã Problem Statement

Delivery delays are a critical challenge in supply chain management, impacting:
- Customer satisfaction and retention
- Operational costs and efficiency
- Company reputation and competitiveness
- Revenue and business growth

This project aims to:
- Analyze logistics data to identify delay patterns
- Build machine learning models to predict delivery status
- Generate actionable recommendations for logistics optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Methodology

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding
- Analyzed business impact of delivery delays
- Examined key variables in the logistics dataset

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data structure inspection and quality assessment
- Statistical analysis of numerical and categorical variables
- Visualization of shipping mode vs. delivery status relationships
- Missing value identification and handling strategies

### Phase 3: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns (IDs, duplicates)
- **Outlier Handling**: Applied 5th-95th percentile capping for critical numerical features
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
- **Categorical Encoding**: 
  - Label encoding for ordinal features
  - One-hot encoding for nominal features
  - Frequency encoding for high-cardinality features
- **Feature Creation**:
  - `shipping_duration`: Days between order and shipping dates
  - `effective_price`: Price after discount calculations
  - `items_per_order`: Total items per order
  - `order_month` & `order_weekday`: Temporal features

### Phase 4: Model Development
- **Data Balancing**: Applied SMOTE for class imbalance handling
- **Algorithms Tested**:
  - Logistic Regression (with class balancing)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Used Optuna for XGBoost tuning
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation

## üìä Dataset Information

**Target Variable**: 
- `-1`: Early delivery
- `0`: On-time delivery  
- `1`: Late delivery

**Key Features** (41 total variables):
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Customer Data | customer_segment, customer_city, customer_country |
| Order Details | order_date, payment_type, order_item_quantity |
| Product Info | category_name, product_price, department_name |
| Shipping | shipping_mode, shipping_date, market |
| Financial | profit_per_order, sales_per_customer, order_item_discount |

## üöÄ How to Reproduce Results

### Prerequisites

4. **Key Execution Notes**:
   - Ensure internet connection for Google Drive data loading
   - Dataset contains 41 features across multiple categories
   - SMOTE is applied to handle class imbalance
   - Optuna optimization may take time depending on n_trials setting

## üìà Key Results & Findings

### Model Performance Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score (Macro) | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.65 | ~0.40 | Baseline with class balancing |
| Random Forest | ~0.85 | ~0.60 | Good performance on balanced data |
| **XGBoost (Optimized)** | **~0.87** | **~0.65** | **Best performing model** |

### Key Insights from Analysis

1. **Shipping Mode Impact**:
   - Standard Class has highest percentage of late deliveries
   - Same Day and First Class show most reliable performance

2. **Geographical Factors**:
   - Delivery performance varies significantly by region
   - Certain customer cities/states show higher delay rates

3. **Feature Importance** (Top Contributors):
   - Shipping mode and duration
   - Geographical features (region, city frequency)
   - Order characteristics (items per order, effective price)
   - Customer segment information

### Class Distribution Insights
- **Original Dataset**: Heavily imbalanced toward on-time deliveries
- **After SMOTE**: Balanced distribution improved model performance
- **Business Impact**: Most delays occur in Standard Class shipping
